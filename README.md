# Saleh Abedinezhad | Data Analyst & Aspiring Data Scientist

Hello! I'm **Saleh Abedinezhad**, a data analyst with a background in software engineering and a passion for turning raw data into clear, impactful insights. My journey into data began during my academic years and evolved into building automated pipelines, machine learning models, and professional data reports.

My recent focus has been on **ETL pipelines**, **SQL optimization**, and **automated reporting systems**. I enjoy crafting tools that simplify complex workflows and improve the clarity of data presentations.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build efficient **ETL workflows** that extract data from relational databases, apply transformations using Python logic, and deliver final outputs through visual reports or formatted files. Along the way, I care deeply about clean code, proper documentation, and polished presentation of results.

Whether I’m cleaning messy data, designing a reporting tool, or building a predictive model, my goal is to add value through insight and automation.

### 🔍 Core Skills:
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data for analysis and reporting
- **SQL & Databases**: Writing optimized queries and handling relational data (SQL Server, MySQL)
- **Data Automation**: Building scripts for recurring analysis and report generation
- **Tabular Output Libraries**: Presenting data using tools like `prettytable`, `tabulate`, `df_table`, and `d-tail` for clean console/table displays
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies
- **Machine Learning**: Modeling real-world problems using supervised learning
- **Data Visualization**: Communicating results using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Python Programming**: Writing modular, efficient, and well-documented code
- **Excel**: Advanced functions and report building
- **AI Tools**: Leveraging tools like ChatGPT & AlphaCode to boost productivity
