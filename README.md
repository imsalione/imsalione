# Saleh Abedinezhad | Data Analyst & Aspiring Data Scientist

Hello! I'm **Saleh Abedinezhad**, a passionate data analyst with a background in software engineering and a strong interest in transforming raw data into actionable insights. My journey into data began during my university studies, and over time, it has expanded into working with **machine learning**, **data automation**, and **ETL pipelines**.

With a focus on real-world problem-solving, I love creating efficient workflows that extract, process, and present data in meaningful ways—whether through dashboards, reports, or predictive models.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I specialize in building **end-to-end data pipelines**, particularly for **ETL workflows**, where I extract data from databases, transform it with business logic, and load it into structured formats for analysis or reporting. I use Python and SQL extensively to automate data handling, ensuring high-quality results with reproducible code.

I’m also passionate about using **AI tools** to speed up development and unlock new capabilities in the data science lifecycle.

### 🔍 Core Skills:
- **ETL Pipelines**: Designing and implementing data extraction, transformation, and loading processes
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Making data analysis-ready with Pandas & NumPy
- **SQL & Database Management**: Writing complex queries and optimizing performance (MySQL, SQL Server)
- **Automated Reporting**: Exporting query results to Excel via Python
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Revealing patterns and outliers
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling and evaluation
- **Data Visualization**: Communicating insights through charts and plots (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Python Programming**: Clean, modular, and scalable code
- **Excel**: Data manipulation, dashboards, and advanced formulas
- **AI Tools**: Using ChatGPT, AlphaCode, and others for faster prototyping
